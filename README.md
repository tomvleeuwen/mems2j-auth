# MEMS2J Authentication responder
This archive contains an old script that simulates the Rover T4
connected to a MEMS2J ecu, with the purpose of finding all 
challenge-response combinations to unlock the MEMS2J ECU.

Combined with a correctly configured TestBook software, it will log
one challenge-response combination for each time the TestBook software
thinks it connects to the ECU.

By automating the mouseclicks, it is possible to obtain all 
challenge-response combinations.

Results are also provided.
